            "There is currently no limit to how far back you can search. You can revisit anything you've seen since installing the app. In the future, you'll also be able to set a custom retention period and mark specific days as important and persist those recordings for longer.",

I'm building advanced filtering and complex queries so you can combine logical expressions, filter by app metadata, and narrow down searches precisely. Think of it as Command+F for your entire screen history. I'm also prioritizing performance over experimental features, keeping the tool lightweight and fast.",

            "It's free during early access because I need your feedback to shape the product. This is an alpha version, so you'll encounter bugs and rough edges. In exchange for using it free, I'm asking you to help improve it. Once it's more polished, it will be a paid app. There's no investor money behind this, so I need to fund development sustainably.",
