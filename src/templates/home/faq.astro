I'm building advanced filtering and complex queries so you can combine logical expressions, filter by app metadata, and narrow down searches precisely. Think of it as Command+F for your entire screen history. I'm also prioritizing performance over experimental features, keeping the tool lightweight and fast.",

In exchange for using it free, I'm asking you to help improve it. Once it's more polished, it will be a paid subscription. There's no investor money behind this, so I need to fund development sustainably.",
